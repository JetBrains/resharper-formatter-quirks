# ReSharper quirky formattings

This is a plugin that shows how to implement some of the quirkier formatting-related features.

This Rider/ReSharper plugin closely follows the structure defined in the [rider plugin template](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-rider-plugin). The documentation on how to build it may be found in the template's documentation.
